**Test Plan for GroceryMate - New Features**

---

### **1. Overview**

#### **Objective**

This test plan outlines the approach for validating new features introduced in the GroceryMate webshop. The goal is to ensure these features function as expected, integrate smoothly with existing functionalities, and provide a seamless user experience.

#### **New Features Under Test**

- **Product Rating System**: Allows customers to rate and review products.
- **Age Verification for Alcoholic Products**: Restricts purchases based on age validation.
- **Dynamic Shipping Cost Calculation**: Automatically updates shipping costs based on user input.

#### **Key Risks to Mitigate**

- Users being unable to leave or view ratings properly.
- Age verification being bypassed or failing incorrectly.
- Incorrect shipping costs leading to checkout issues or abandoned carts.

### **2. Scope of Testing**

#### **In Scope**

- **Core functionalities of new features** (Rating, Age Verification, Shipping Cost Calculation).
- **User interactions with these features**, including login dependencies.
- **Integration with existing checkout and purchase flows.**
- **Frontend and backend validation of age verification.**
- **Usability testing to ensure ease of use and clarity.**
- **Performance testing for dynamic calculations under various conditions.**

#### **Out of Scope**

- Security validation of third-party payment gateways.
- Backend database performance optimization.
- Load testing beyond expected usage scenarios.

### **3. Testing Approach**

#### **Testing Strategy**

1. **Exploratory Testing** (Initial Phase)

   - Conduct unscripted testing to identify usability issues and edge cases.
   - Explore potential user paths, including error handling.

2. **Structured Test Execution**

   - Develop test cases based on feature specifications.
   - Execute functional, usability, performance, and security tests.

3. **Regression Testing**

   - Ensure new features do not introduce issues into existing workflows.

#### **Types of Testing**

- **Functional Testing:** Validate expected behavior of each new feature.
- **Usability Testing:** Assess ease of use from a customerâ€™s perspective.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure real-time calculations work efficiently.
- **Security Testing:** Confirm proper handling of sensitive user data.
- **Regression Testing:** Identify unintended side effects on existing functionality.
